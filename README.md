A different take on a portfolio website - making a small rpg game displaying my accomplishments and aspirations!

## Current Live Demo

https://63d1adbe7dae34135eb4da1f--soft-sprite-e8b283.netlify.app/

## How to Run

- Clone the repository or download a zip file
- go into the directory and run `npm start`

## Controls

- Use the `WASD` keys to move around
- Press the `Space` bar near a item to see a menu with details of my work and life

## Project's Scope

- to reinvent the wheel of a portfolio website by creating an jrpg-like feel to it
- to gain more practice in full stack development (specifically with react)
- to create several scenes displaying my work (Music, Programming) as well as my hobbies (Geography, Dance, ect.)

### Tools

- Tiled: a program for creating 2d scenes: https://www.mapeditor.org/
- React.js for front end and game loop functions (create-react-app): https://create-react-app.dev/

### To Do

- fix menu glitch (player runs really fast after clicking a item with a menu)
- refactor classes in Scene.js to their seperate files, along with functions for cleanliness
- create path for 2 other scenes

## Aspirations
