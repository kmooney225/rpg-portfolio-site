A different take on a portfolio website - making a small rpg game displaying my accomplishments and aspirations!

## Project's Scope

- to reinvent the wheel of a portfolio website by creating an jrpg-like feel to it
- to gain more practice in full stack development (specifically with react)

## Tools

- Tiled: a program for creating 2d scenes 
- React.js for front end and game loop functions

## To Do

- fix menu glitch (player runs really fast after clicking a item with a menu)
- refactor classes in Scene.js to their seperate files, along with functions for cleanliness
- create path for 2 other scenes

## Aspirations

- https://dev.to/flagrede/making-a-2d-rpg-game-with-react-tree-fiber-4af1 (2d game demo made using react-three-fibers)
